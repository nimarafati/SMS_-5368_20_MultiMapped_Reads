# MultiMapped_reads in RNAseq
## Introduction 
The aim of this project is to summarise list of tools and codes to perform QC for some of the projects we had problems with multimapped reads and rRNA enrichment and few other problems. The collcted information may be implemented in other pipelines as QC pre and post-alignment.
